            <p>Hi! My name is Ria. Welcome to my website! It is such an honor for you to read this website. Let me give you some background information: I am 20 years old and I am currently a third-year university student majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Philosophy. I created this website initially as a blog. I love being creative and aesthetic. I love sharing how I view the world in my perspective. I consider myself as an aestheticist. At first, I major in Computer Science because I was unsure of what to do later in life. Initially, I did not like coding whatsoever. I hated it. In fact, I prefer doing math rather than coding. I was very frustrated, burnt-out due to my classes even though I was getting A's in them. Yes, I was technically gifted in the field but I did not feel passion. Combine all this confusion with depression, and when I hit the bottom was when it was really hard. I really thought I was not going to live. However, it all changed when I talked to a few individuals on a online gaming platform called Roblox.</p>
            <p>To be honest, I have no idea who they are. But I do know their stories. They were also in the same field as me, well sort of, they were cybersecurity majors. But hearing their stories and the advice they gave to me was just so impactful, and that is when I decided to turn my life around. I started creating. I don't do this for others. I do this for myself. I realize that no one will save you. Therefore, you have to do it all on your own. Just create. Don't worry about it not being perfect. Just create. Do projects. And that is exactly what I am doing right now. As you will see, I will be constantly be adding new pages on my website. Why? Well, because I just love creating. I will be having a new project each week.</p>
            <p>This website is a journal of love. In fact, a love letter for me. I realize I love being aesthetic and also sharing the world around me. So, why need to plan the website? When I can just keep doing what I want to do. No need for perfection. I have so many interests. I started reading, I want to discuss philosophy, I want to be a podcaster. I want to start a homelab. So, why wait? I will share the world for you guys. And I hope you can interact with me too! But if not, that is fine. You'll just hop on and off on the bus to my life. </p>
            <p>So, feel free to explore, message me about your interests, send me letters. Do whatever you like. Welcome to my life. :)</p>
