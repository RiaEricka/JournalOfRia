            <h2>Life Updates</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Ria. Welcome to my website! It is such an honor for you to read this website. Let me give you some background information: I am 20 years old and I am currently a third-year university student majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Philosophy. I created this website initially as a blog. I love being creative and aesthetic. I love sharing how I view the world in my perspective. I consider myself as an aestheticist. At first, I major in Computer Science because I was unsure of what to do later in life. Initially, I did not like coding whatsoever. I hated it. In fact, I prefer doing math rather than coding. I was very frustrated, burnt-out due to my classes even though I was getting A's in them. Yes, I was technically gifted in the field but I did not feel passion. Combine all this confusion with depression, and when I hit the bottom was when it was really hard. I really thought I was not going to live. However, it all changed when I talked to a few individuals on a online gaming platform called Roblox.</p>

            <h2>Author's Note</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Ria. I just want to say welcome to my website. Feel free to explore, comment, or even send me a message! I created this website as a way to show my adventures but also to document my life. When people ask me to describe myself or you know when job interviews ask you to "tell me about yourself", I always have difficulty responding to this question. I don't think I can be classified into different aspects. I am many things and I have many passions. It is a shame that I can't explore all of them in my lifetime. However, I will try my best to explore. I am currently a 3rd year student majoring in Computer Science, and let me tell you something; I am not ready to graduate. Looking back 3 years ago, there were so many things that I wish I could tell my first year self. But, I think the most important thing I wanted to tell her is that it is okay not to be perfect - just do it, no amount of preparation can prepare for a single experience. In order to have that experience, you must be able to go in blind and afraid and come out as a wise person. 
            </p>
            <p>I created this website not only as a blog, but as a journal for myself. A platform where I can share my experiences and philosophy (I'm considering doing a minor in Philosophy!). I hope that my journey can bring some sort of emotion out of you, the reader! Anger, laughter, curious, etc. I will be constantly updating and innovating my journal. Maybe I'll be adding new API's or even explore new styles. I still have no idea what I want to do with my degree and/or what job I would like later on life, but at least I can have website building as part of my skills (haha). One more last note, which is dedicated to my dear readers (to who are still reading until the very end, good job!), if you weren't here, I wouldn't be here and be sharing my passion for life. Thank you, I am truly grateful. </p>
